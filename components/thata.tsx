              <li>
                Sri Avadhutha Rami Reddy Thatha was born to Hanumanth Reddy and
                Eshwaramma in 1949 on Shravan Bahula Ashtami (Sri Krishna Janmashtami),
                at Anugonda village, Kurnool District, Andhra Pradesh.
              </li>

              <li>
                Like Lord Krishna, he exhibited divine miracles from childhood.
                At age 13, Tatha moved from Anugonda to Kallur, 3km from Kurnool.
              </li>

              <li>
                In the Kurnool region, revered personalities are lovingly called
                Nayana or Tatha. Devotees accepted him as the head of their family,
                which is why he came to be known as Tatha.
              </li>

              <li>
                An Avadhuta is beyond caste, creed, worldly concerns, ego, or pleasure.
                They remain in a state of pure awareness, free from birth and death,
                virtue and sin, form and limitations.
              </li>

              <li>
                Avadhutas possess boundless compassion, divine knowledge, and the ability
                to guide devotees toward renunciation, purity, and salvation.
                Sri Ramavadhuta is believed to be an incarnation of Lord Dattatreya.
              </li>

              <li>
                Blessed is the soil of Kallur, which received his holy presence.
                Tatha cared for devotees with immense love, destroyed their karmic burdens,
                uplifted lives, and fulfilled righteous desires.
              </li>

              <li>
                On 15 January 1993, Tatha took Mahasamidhi. His physical body left the world,
                but his eternal divine presence continues to guide and bless devotees.
              </li>

              <li>
                After Mahasamidhi, a Sansthan was established to continue daily poojas,
                spiritual activities, and social service in his name.
              </li>
